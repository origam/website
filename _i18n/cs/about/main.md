## How it all started
We started the company in 2003, at first focusing on delivering various IT solutions to small and medium businesses. We soon realized there was a demand for a 
solution that would have all the benefits of custom software, but none of its drawbacks, and so we started focusing on software engineering. ORIGAM was born.

### Focus on partnership
In 2013 we decided to change our strategy and focus exclusively on software implementers and developers and let our partners be in direct contact with their end customers. ORIGAM was born. We believe our partners know their clients needs better than us, and so we focus on giving them the right tools to get the job done.

### Opensource
In 2017 we decided to release ORIGAM as opensource.

## How it all started
We started the company in 2003, at first focusing on delivering various IT solutions to small and medium businesses. We soon realized there was a demand for a 
solution that would have all the benefits of custom software, but none of its drawbacks, and so we started focusing on software engineering. ORIGAM was born.

### Focus on partnership
In 2013 we decided to change our strategy and focus exclusively on software implementers and developers and let our partners be in direct contact with their end customers. ORIGAM was born. We believe our partners know their clients needs better than us, and so we focus on giving them the right tools to get the job done.

### Opensource
In 2017 we decided to release ORIGAM as opensource. 

## Mission Statement
We want ORIGAM to become No. 1 solution for all developers who demand maximum flexibility, reliability and real time technical support.

## Brand Story

A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH A SINGLE STEP
-- Lao Tse

Imagine an origami: you start with an idea, the final design in your head. You fold the paper, then again. You practice, start with something simple and follow the instructions. You prototype. Gaining expertise, you try more and more sophisticated designs, and finally you master the whole thing from the idea through custom made development to a fully functional solution.

ThatÂ´s exactly how ORIGAM works.

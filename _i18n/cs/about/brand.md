## Brand Story

A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH A SINGLE STEP
-- Lao Tse

Imagine an origami: you start with an idea, the final design in your head. You fold the paper, then again. You practice, start with something simple and follow the instructions. You prototype. Gaining expertise, you try more and more sophisticated designs, and finally you master the whole thing from the idea through custom made development to a fully functional solution.

ThatÂ´s exactly how ORIGAM works.

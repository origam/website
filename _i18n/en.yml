    text: "<p> Imagine origami: start with an idea, a final concept on your mind. Fold a piece of paper, and then once again. Practice, begin with something simple and follow the instructions. Prototype. Gain experience and try more sophisticated models. Eventually, you can do the whole thing: from an idea to custom development and workable solution.</p> 
      <p>This is exactly how ORIGAM works.</p>"

    date: 2003 
    title: New company founded 
    explanation: At first we focused on general IT solutions for SMEs. But we soon spotted a high demand for a solution that would have all the benefits of a custom software but offset its drawbacks. So we got into software development, and ORIGAM was born. 
  - 
    date: 2013 
    title: Focus on partners 
    explanation: We decided to change our strategy and put 100% focus on software implementers and developers. We leave it to our partners to be in direct contact with the customer, as they know them better than we ever could. Our responsibility was therefore to supply the right tools so that our partners can do their job the best way possible.

    date: 2017

      It enables quick, objective and data-driven analysis of each convict's
      case, including the risk of relapse. It eliminates human error in
      judgment and presents a new level of rigidity in the evaluation of
      criminal cases. We've managed the project with great savings in time

    title: Sugar refinery solves logistics
    content: TTD, the biggest sugar refinery in the country, had a problem with trucks. Anywhere between 50 and 200 unload their loads of beets at the refinery's doorstep every day. Come too many, the roads get jammed. Come too few and the whole operation might shut down. So all drivers used to be manually coordinated via cellphones. Labor intensive, imprecise, messy… until they turned to ORIGAM.
      Real time tracking. Automatic monitoring of the cargo’s size. Ongoing correlation with lab analyses determining the quality of the beets. The platform now monitors inputs from the producers regarding soil quality, creates invoices based on lab results and much much more.

    title: Insurance policies under control
    content: How do you keep track of thousands of insurance contracts? You could use MS Office – slow, messy, cumbersome. Or you could build your own system underpinned by ORIGAM. AGV, a Swiss insurance company, did just that. In less than ninety „man–days“, we had a working system that automated document creation, scanning, barcode based sorting and even allowed the civil service access via extranet. All that for 50% less than the standard issue software running on SAP. (image &copy; Klaus Graf, CC-BY 2.5)
